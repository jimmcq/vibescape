# VibeScape: Audio-Reactive 3D Landscape
*A Vibe Coding Project - Where Music Becomes Visual Reality*

## üéµ Project Vision
Create an immersive, living 3D landscape that transforms audio into flowing, organic visuals. Think "flying through music made visible" - a dreamy, psychedelic environment where every beat, melody, and rhythm becomes part of a beautiful, ever-changing world.

## üõ† Technical Foundation
- **Three.js** - 3D rendering, scene management, camera controls
- **Web Audio API** - Real-time frequency analysis and audio processing
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Keep it simple, keep it flowing
- **HTML5 Canvas** - Our visual stage
- **Optional: Tone.js** - For any audio synthesis needs

## üéß Audio Sources (In Order of Implementation)
1. **Microphone Input** - Live audio from user (singing, instruments, ambient)
2. **File Upload** - Drag & drop MP3/WAV files
3. **Built-in Samples** - 3-4 demo tracks across different genres/vibes
4. **SoundCloud Integration** - Public tracks/playlists (if the vibe flows naturally)
5. **Interactive Elements** - Virtual instruments or procedural audio generation

## üèó Development Flow (Vibe-First Approach)

### Phase 1: Audio Foundation
- Set up Web Audio API context
- Create frequency analyzer (FFT)
- Test with microphone input
- Extract frequency bands: bass (0-100Hz), mids (100-2kHz), highs (2kHz+)

### Phase 2: Basic Landscape
- Initialize Three.js scene with camera and lighting
- Create procedural terrain mesh
- Make terrain vertices respond to bass frequencies
- Add basic color shifting based on audio intensity

### Phase 3: Particle Magic
- Particle system that responds to mid-range frequencies
- Particles spawn, move, and fade based on melody/rhythm
- Different particle behaviors for different frequency ranges
- Consider: stars, sparkles, floating orbs, flowing streams

### Phase 4: Color Symphony
- Dynamic color palettes that shift with music
- Map frequency ranges to HSL color spaces
- Smooth color transitions and gradients
- Background/atmosphere color changes

### Phase 5: Camera Flow
- Smooth camera movement following audio energy
- Auto-flying through the landscape
- Optional: User control with mouse/touch for exploration
- Camera height/angle responds to audio dynamics

### Phase 6: Visual Polish
- Lighting effects (spotlights, ambient glow)
- Post-processing effects (bloom, depth of field)
- Smooth interpolation and easing for all animations
- Performance optimization

### Phase 7: Audio Source Expansion
- File upload functionality
- Built-in sample tracks
- SoundCloud integration (if viable)
- Audio controls (play/pause, volume, track selection)

## üé® Aesthetic Goals
- **Organic & Flowing** - Nothing rigid or mechanical
- **Immersive** - Pull the viewer into the world
- **Responsive** - Every visual element reacts to audio
- **Dreamy** - Ethereal, almost psychedelic atmosphere
- **Smooth** - Seamless transitions and movements

## üöÄ Vibe Coding Principles for This Project
1. **Start broad, refine through iteration** - "Make terrain pulse" ‚Üí "Make it pulse smoothly with bass"
2. **Aesthetic over architecture** - If it looks amazing, the code is doing its job
3. **Embrace happy accidents** - Unexpected visual effects might be features
4. **Conversational development** - Describe the vibe, let AI handle implementation
5. **Immediate visual feedback** - Every change should be visible instantly
6. **Flow state focus** - Keep momentum, avoid getting stuck on perfect solutions

## üéØ Success Metrics
- **Wow Factor** - Does it make you stop and stare?
- **Audio Responsiveness** - Do the visuals feel connected to the music?
- **Immersion** - Can you lose yourself watching it?
- **Smoothness** - Are transitions and movements fluid?
- **Vibe Alignment** - Does it capture that "music made visual" feeling?

## üìù Development Notes
- Keep all code in a single HTML file for easy iteration
- Use CDN links for libraries (no build process complexity)
- Focus on real-time performance (aim for 60fps)
- Start simple, layer complexity through conversation
- Document the vibe coding process as we go

*Next step: Set up the development environment and begin with Phase 1 - Audio Foundation. Let the conversation guide the code, and let the music guide the visuals.*
